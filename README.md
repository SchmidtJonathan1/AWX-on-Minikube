[![Ansible Lint](https://github.com/TimGrt/AWX-on-Minikube/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TimGrt/AWX-on-Minikube/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/timgrt/awx-on-minikube/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/timgrt/awx-on-minikube)

This playbook installs AWX on a Minikube instance running on an Fedora host.

## Requirements

A managed node with sufficient CPU and memory resources is necessary, at least:

* 4 Cores
* 6-8 GB RAM

Run the `check-requirements.yml` playbook to ensure that your Ansible Controller has all required Collections and Python packages installed.  

Install necessary Galaxy requirements:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

Install necessary Python requirements:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.yml
```

Adjust the inventory.  
The playbook needs *sudo* permissions, either set an appropriate user or use the `bootstrap.yml` playbook which prepares the managed node.  

Run the playbook and provide a user which can access the managed node and has root permissions, a dedicated *ansible* user with sudo permissions is created and all packages are updated to latest state. Default configuration method is remote, but you can set it up local as well. Use extra vars method=local instead of method=remote
```bash
ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml -e ansible_user=<default-user> --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
# For local installation use 
ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml ' --connection local -e method=local --ask-become-pass'
```

## Usage

After installing all requirements, run the `main.yml` playbook.

```bash
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

The playbook will output further informations.
